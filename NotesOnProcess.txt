Yellow Circle Notes

Original Concepts for Game:
-A Semi-Walking sim where you would speak to random NPCs in a post apocalyptic environment to find the Yellow
Circle, an entity that caused the apocalypse and kill it, whether it be for revenge or to try and save the world.
Players would learn about the world as they did this. Ultimately decided there wasn't enough time to write enough
of a story for this to work.

-A Wave fighter.  There would be constant waves of eyes being sent after you as the last person in a post apocalyptic
world after being taken over by the Yellow Circle.  You would have to fight them off, with there being multiple types.
Idea ultimately stopped after realizing that along with learning how to properly spawn enemies in waves, there'd also
have to be various types of enemies for challenge, and coming up with the various types could've added on too much time.

-Final concept.  The simple but efficient atmospheric collect and run game.  A single eye chases you, getting faster
with each item you collect.  Ultimately, if you fail to figure out how to slow it down you will lose shortly after the 
halfway point.  Still a post apocalyptic story, with the Yellow Circle being an entity that constantly looks down on you
throughout the process of the game.

Unused Ideas:
-Multiple Eyes Spawning
Ultimately scrapped because they would all end up overlapping each other following you. Making them vary in speed
would just make one more efficient than the others.

-Fighting and Killing the Eye
Seemed unnecessary.  Also wouldn't make any sense with the story.

-The Yellow Eye Attacking
Was going to fire a laser at your position after you had all 15 effigies.  Scrapped because it would either
be too easy (player is constantly moving anyway) or too difficult (instantly homing in and killing the player).
